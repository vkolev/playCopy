  1. Introduction

	Well as you may know, *playCopy* is a python script, witch is designed for the people, who
like to share the music they are listening with their friends in Skype, ICQ etc, using a simple
global HotKey combination. 
	The script works as follows: 
		- Check if one of the supported players is playing
		- Copy the name of the artist and the title of the song
		- Combine the artist and the title in one string
		- Send the end string to the clipboard
	The script supports the following players:
		- Rhythmbox
		- mocp
		- Exaile
		- Banshee

  2. Installation

	The installation is very simple. After you have extracted the downloaded archive you need
to do the following:
		- Make the *playCopy* script executable:
			$ chmod +x playCopy
		- Copy the playCopy script to /usr/bin as root:
			# cp playCopy /usr/bin

  3. Defining the HotKey

	Here is the tricky part. To define a global HotKey for executing the script you need to do
the following steps:
		- Start gconf-editor
		- Go to apps -> metacity -> keybinding_commands
		- Select the variable command_1 end set value: playCopy
		- Now go to apps -> metacity -> global_keybinding
		- Select the variable run_command_1 end set value: <Control><Alt>c
*** You can insert your preferered key-combination, but don't forget the < and > tags

  4. Using playCopy as a module
  
	playCopy can also be used as a module for other Python scripts. To use it, simply rename playCode to playCode.py and use as follows:
	
	import playCopy
	print playCopy.cur_song() # Use playCopy.cur_song() however you wish!

  5. Enable/Disable the notification
	
	In order to enable or disable the notifications is to edit the playCopy script and set the variable show_not, where:
		1 : Enabled (notification for the current playing song will be shown)
		0 : Disabled (no notification will be shown)

Have fun and don't hesitate to suggest new players or other options to the script.
